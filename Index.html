        <p>KOKOKO! is an indescribable band from the Decomcratic Republic of Congo. They produce a beautiful mix of electronic, recycled and traditional African music to make a high energy danceable album. Sung in their native language the internal messages are not immediate to westeners but that does not detract from the joy of the music. But beyond the surface lies the story of the Congelese. A story of exploitation, slavery and theft of resources from wealthy colonials. Overall this creates a beaufitul and impactful collection of music that is diverse and fun.</p>

    <h2>Present Tense by Wild Beasts</h2>
        <img src="b7825bbe.jpg" width="320" height="320">
   
    <p> Wild Beasts was an English Band formed in 2002 that sadly disbanded in 2018. Fortunately they left behind a catalog of wonderful music spanning five albums. Their fourth studio album, in my opinion. is their best. Produced after experiencing burnout from constant touring they sat down to focus on song writing and produced a beautiful and dreamy indie pop/rock album. With heavy synth and soft vocals this album could be listened to while trying to sleep or on a roadtrip with friends. A very calming and emotional presence persists through the whole album. While maintaning that calmness they also manage to create some very epic moments of the elbum. A highlight for me is pregnant pause with the slow breaks followed by intense synths. The album comes across very versatile and polished. It is a rarity to find a collection of music where you can simultaniously focus your attenton on the entirety of it while also having it take you to another place and this album does just that.</p>

    <h2> Soul of Ferguson by Brian Owens and the Deacons of Soul</h2>
        <img src="brianowens-soul.jpg" width="320" Height="320">
    
    <p>Brian Owens is a strong and soulful R&B musician from Ferguson who brings together a collective of Ferguson musicians to bring forward a powerful collection of heavy soul. With guest vocals from Michael McDonald, another Ferguson native, on the track For You. This project runs deep. Owens having grown up singing in churches he brings a certain feel to the music that comforts and excites you. At times upbeat and at others deeply emotional this album puts you through the paces of emotions but is danceable the whole way through. A masterpiece of music and a timeless sound.</p>
